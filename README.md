# Week 02 - Iteration, Greyboxing and Playtesting
Today we will be getting familiar with the use of iterative design in our game making process. We will be introducing you to the idea of playtesting and experience goals to achieve this.

## Tools used
Today's task uses (but is not limited to):

* Github Desktop (or your Github client of choice)
* Unreal Engine

## Assignment deliverable
There is no direct assignment deliverable today. However, your iteration on your scene from last week will help you get a better grip on how to think about designing your level for particular experiences, and expose you to the process of playtesting. These skills will be necessary for the Level Design Task.

## Opening the new project
Today we'll be started with a (slightly bug-fixed) version of the template project, found inside this repo. Open it up as you did last time. You'll notice there is no level this time! So let's make one.

Instead of creating a new scene today, you'll be iterating on what you built last week. If you have not created any sort of level from last week, spend some time doing so now. You may even want to revisit last week's sheet for some ideas.

If you haven't got it, clone/pull the latest version of your lab repo from last week. Take a minute or so to refresh your memory of the project. Consider some of the big-picture design qualities of your level:

* Does the player know where they are going?
* Are there any "leaps of faith" or other times the player can't see where they are jumping to?
* Are all the jumps or other necessary movements reasonably possible? If not, why?

These questions are a bit hard to answer on our own. So it is time to playtest!

You will want to be taking notes throughout this lesson. I highly recommend you place your notes in the repo along with your project, such as adding a markdown file, a text file, or taking notes in a design journal you keep with you when working. Whatever you do, the important thing is that you are recording your design process, as this will be a core skill for you as a designer.

## First playtest (10 min)
Now, enlist another student to come and playtest your game. Play each other's games, heading for the door goal.

While playing your peer's game, consider the same questions as above. You may wish to jot down some notes as you play to share with your peer. Don't worry about going too in-depth: this is a relatively exploratory playest to get you familiar with the process.

Once you've both played each other's games, discuss. Describe your experience and findings with your partner about their level, and make sure you are noting down anything they have to say about yours. Pay special attention to anything they say that you didn't notice about your level.

## First Iteration (15 min)
With this feedback in mind, start iterating on your level.

Start thinking about higher-level experience goals. While we'll dive into this in later weeks, consider:

* Are you trying to make a challenging level? If so, what kind of challenge? Is it about quick reflexes and movement, or slow and deliberate path-choosing?
* Do you instead want to make a more "chill" and exploratory experience, with more spaces for the player to take their time and enjoy the vibe?

...Or maybe something else entirely!

Write this high-level experience goal down, and cater your re-design to try and achieve it.

Once you are happy with what you've made, make sure you save and push your repo. Add a meaningful commit message regarding how you've adapted the feedback given. If you're recording your notes inside your repo as we recommend, make sure you push them as well.

## Second playtest (10 min)
Jot down a couple of questions to ask your next playtester. These questions should relate to the changes you've made, but also your high-level experience goals. For instance, if you were going for a game that was meant to be physically challenging (quick reflexes, etc) you could ask them if they found any part of the game particularly hard, what kind of skills they thought they needed, etc.

Repeat the process of swapping with a peer. Ideally, this is someone different to last time.

Once you've played each other's games, take turns answering each other's questions and recording the feedback.

## Second Iteration (15 min)
Using the feedback you've received, make some changes to your level. If your level was "perfect" you either weren't asking deep enough questions, or your playtester was being too kind! Do some self-reflection on what needs to be changed to better achieve your broad experience goal.

Again, push your changes to your repo with a meaningful commit message.

## Reflection and further iteration
If you have time, keep playtesting and iterating. You should by now have some understanding of how you can use reflection and feedback to iterate on your level, refining the experience for the player. 

Take a moment to compare the level you started this class with and the level you have now by taking a screenshot (just as you did last week). If you didn't take a screenshot, you can check out the version of your repo from the start of today to compare the scenes (another good reason to push regularly!).

This is all very introductory in terms of how playtesting and experience goals work. We will be getting deeper into the relevant design theory and practice as semester progresses.

## Next Week
Next week we will be shifting our focus to looking at the "toy" within the 2D Tool Kit, namely the Ellen avatar and how she can interact with the world. See you then!
